About User Interface Project -
- In this project I have design only UI
- Originality: Our application, called "kratin-healthcare," takes a unique approach to elderly care by combining personalized health monitoring, and cognitive stimulation in a single platform. While other applications focus on specific aspects of senior health, such as medication reminders or activity tracking, Senior Vitality offers a holistic solution that promotes overall well-being and improved quality of life.

- Research Skills: Extensive research on existing elderly care applications revealed that many offerings in the market are fragmented and lack a comprehensive approach to senior health. While some apps focus solely on physical health, others primarily address social isolation or mental stimulation. Senior Vitality bridges this gap by providing a unified platform that integrates health monitoring and cognitive exercises to cater to the diverse needs of older adults.
